  <p>Save any pieces if possible. Rinse gently. Avoid very hot or cold food. Wax can cover sharp edges for a short time. Call for a visit. If pain is severe, we will try to see you the same day.</p>
  <h2>Short term steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse the mouth with warm water</li>
    <li>Use temporary dental wax if sharp</li>
    <li>Call to schedule a visit</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>What to expect at the visit</h3>
  <p>We will review the tooth and look for cracks. Some cases need smoothing only. Others need a filling or a crown. Care instructions are clear and simple.</p>
  <p>For crowns, see <a href="#/services/crowns" data-route>same day crowns</a>. For general info, <a href="#/" data-route>click here</a>.</p>

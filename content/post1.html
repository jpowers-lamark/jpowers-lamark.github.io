  <h1>How to Choose the Right Marathon Shoe</h1>
  <p class="muted">By Staff • Published: <time datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time></p>
  <p>This guide covers stack height, drop, and foam density. Picking footwear can reduce risk of injury during training. The right fit helps alignment. While this is a health topic, our clinic is focused on teeth, so consider this general wellness advice rather than medical care. If you grind teeth during training we can help with night guards.</p>
  <h2>Footwear basics</h2>
  <p>Stack height affects cushioning. Drop changes how the foot lands. Foam density shapes feel. There is no perfect shoe for all people. Try several models. Rotate pairs to vary loading. <a href="#/services" data-route>Learn more</a>.</p>
  <h3>Common mistakes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Buying based on color instead of fit</li>
    <li>Skipping a break in period</li>
    <li>Changing drop too fast</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>When shoes cause mouth guards</h3>
  <p>If training stress leads to clenching, a night guard might help. See our <a href="#/services/cleanings" data-route>care pages</a>.</p>
